timburman: @workspace Here read everything in the workspace, learn what i have built till now in the contracts... i have also implemened dynamic staking, so get a gist of it and rewrite the phases of dev according to that.. one more thing the check marks are not visible to me, so adjust that or write the phases in the .MD format so that i'll copy and paste it in there and read it easily, or you can do as you like but make sure that the check marks are visible currently it is showing something like this: "<input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Liquidity management tools"

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationLooking at your workspace, I can see you've built a comprehensive DAO voting system with dynamic staking capabilities. Let me analyze what you've implemented and provide an updated development roadmap.

## Current Implementation Analysis

Your DAO system includes:

### Core Contracts
- **GovernanceToken.sol** - ERC20 token with voting capabilities
- **BasicVestingGovernanceToken.sol** - Token with vesting functionality
- **VotingContract.sol** - Main governance/voting logic
- **StakingContract.sol** - Basic staking implementation
- **APRStakingContract.sol** - Dynamic APR-based staking
- **FixedAPRStakingContract.sol** - Fixed APR staking (newer addition)
- **IStakingContract.sol** - Staking interface

### Key Features Implemented
- Token-based governance with voting power
- Multiple staking mechanisms (basic, dynamic APR, fixed APR)
- Vesting functionality for controlled token distribution
- Comprehensive test coverage

- [ ] Proposal categorization and routing
- [ ] Voting power delegation mechanisms
- [ ] Cross-chain governance support

### Phase 6: Integration and Deployment 📋 PENDING

- [ ] Liquidity management tools

### Phase 7: Advanced Analytics and Tools 📋 PENDING
- [ ] Governance analytics dashboard
- [ ] Voting participation tracking
- [ ] Staking reward optimization tools
- [ ] Automated proposal execution
- [ ] Community engagement metrics

## Technical Architecture Strengths

Your current implementation shows:
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns with interfaces
- **Multiple Staking Options**: Both dynamic and fixed APR mechanisms
- **OpenZeppelin Integration**: Leveraging battle-tested contracts from openzeppelin-contracts
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test files for major contracts
- **Foundry Framework**: Modern development environment with foundry.toml

## Next Immediate Steps

Based on your current progress, I recommend focusing on:

1. **Enhance VotingContract.sol** with proposal management
2. **Integrate staking power** with voting weight calculations
3. **Add timelock mechanisms** for proposal execution
4. **Implement comprehensive access controls**

Your dynamic staking implementation gives users flexibility in reward mechanisms, which is an excellent foundation for a modern DAO system. The next phase should focus on connecting this staking power to actual governance decisions.
