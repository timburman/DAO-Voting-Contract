## ERC20Burnable

_Extension of {ERC20} that allows token holders to destroy both their own
tokens and those that they have an allowance for, in a way that can be
recognized off-chain (via event analysis)._

### Contract
ERC20Burnable : .deps/npm/@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Burnable.sol

Extension of {ERC20} that allows token holders to destroy both their own
tokens and those that they have an allowance for, in a way that can be
recognized off-chain (via event analysis).

 --- 
### Functions:
### burn

```solidity
function burn(uint256 value) public virtual
```

_Destroys a `value` amount of tokens from the caller.

See {ERC20-_burn}._

### burnFrom

```solidity
function burnFrom(address account, uint256 value) public virtual
```

_Destroys a `value` amount of tokens from `account`, deducting from
the caller's allowance.

See {ERC20-_burn} and {ERC20-allowance}.

Requirements:

- the caller must have allowance for ``accounts``'s tokens of at least
`value`._

inherits ERC20:
### name

```solidity
function name() public view virtual returns (string)
```

_Returns the name of the token._

### symbol

```solidity
function symbol() public view virtual returns (string)
```

_Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the
name._

### decimals

```solidity
function decimals() public view virtual returns (uint8)
```

_Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should
be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).

Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
Ether and Wei. This is the default value returned by this function, unless
it's overridden.

NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including
{IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}._

### totalSupply

```solidity
function totalSupply() public view virtual returns (uint256)
```

_See {IERC20-totalSupply}._

### balanceOf

```solidity
function balanceOf(address account) public view virtual returns (uint256)
```

_See {IERC20-balanceOf}._

### transfer

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-transfer}.

Requirements:

- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- the caller must have a balance of at least `value`._

### allowance

```solidity
function allowance(address owner, address spender) public view virtual returns (uint256)
```

_See {IERC20-allowance}._

### approve

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 value) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-approve}.

NOTE: If `value` is the maximum `uint256`, the allowance is not updated on
`transferFrom`. This is semantically equivalent to an infinite approval.

Requirements:

- `spender` cannot be the zero address._

### transferFrom

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-transferFrom}.

Skips emitting an {Approval} event indicating an allowance update. This is not
required by the ERC. See {xref-ERC20-_approve-address-address-uint256-bool-}[_approve].

NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance
is the maximum `uint256`.

Requirements:

- `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `from` must have a balance of at least `value`.
- the caller must have allowance for ``from``'s tokens of at least
`value`._

### _transfer

```solidity
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 value) internal
```

_Moves a `value` amount of tokens from `from` to `to`.

This internal function is equivalent to {transfer}, and can be used to
e.g. implement automatic token fees, slashing mechanisms, etc.

Emits a {Transfer} event.

NOTE: This function is not virtual, {_update} should be overridden instead._

### _update

```solidity
function _update(address from, address to, uint256 value) internal virtual
```

_Transfers a `value` amount of tokens from `from` to `to`, or alternatively mints (or burns) if `from`
(or `to`) is the zero address. All customizations to transfers, mints, and burns should be done by overriding
this function.

Emits a {Transfer} event._

### _mint

```solidity
function _mint(address account, uint256 value) internal
```

_Creates a `value` amount of tokens and assigns them to `account`, by transferring it from address(0).
Relies on the `_update` mechanism

Emits a {Transfer} event with `from` set to the zero address.

NOTE: This function is not virtual, {_update} should be overridden instead._

### _burn

```solidity
function _burn(address account, uint256 value) internal
```

_Destroys a `value` amount of tokens from `account`, lowering the total supply.
Relies on the `_update` mechanism.

Emits a {Transfer} event with `to` set to the zero address.

NOTE: This function is not virtual, {_update} should be overridden instead_

### _approve

```solidity
function _approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 value) internal
```

_Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over the `owner` s tokens.

This internal function is equivalent to `approve`, and can be used to
e.g. set automatic allowances for certain subsystems, etc.

Emits an {Approval} event.

Requirements:

- `owner` cannot be the zero address.
- `spender` cannot be the zero address.

Overrides to this logic should be done to the variant with an additional `bool emitEvent` argument._

### _approve

```solidity
function _approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 value, bool emitEvent) internal virtual
```

_Variant of {_approve} with an optional flag to enable or disable the {Approval} event.

By default (when calling {_approve}) the flag is set to true. On the other hand, approval changes made by
`_spendAllowance` during the `transferFrom` operation set the flag to false. This saves gas by not emitting any
`Approval` event during `transferFrom` operations.

Anyone who wishes to continue emitting `Approval` events on the`transferFrom` operation can force the flag to
true using the following override:

```solidity
function _approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 value, bool) internal virtual override {
    super._approve(owner, spender, value, true);
}
```

Requirements are the same as {_approve}._

### _spendAllowance

```solidity
function _spendAllowance(address owner, address spender, uint256 value) internal virtual
```

_Updates `owner` s allowance for `spender` based on spent `value`.

Does not update the allowance value in case of infinite allowance.
Revert if not enough allowance is available.

Does not emit an {Approval} event._

### Approval

```solidity
event Approval(address owner, address spender, uint256 value)
```

_Emitted when the allowance of a `spender` for an `owner` is set by

## IERC20Metadata

_Interface for the optional metadata functions from the ERC-20 standard._

### Contract

### Functions:
### name

```solidity
function name() external view returns (string)
```

_Returns the name of the token._

### symbol

```solidity
function symbol() external view returns (string)
```

_Returns the symbol of the token._

### decimals

```solidity
function decimals() external view returns (uint8)
```

_Returns the decimals places of the token._

inherits IERC20:
### totalSupply

```solidity
function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256)
```

_Returns the value of tokens in existence._

### balanceOf

```solidity
function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256)
```

_Returns the value of tokens owned by `account`._

### transfer

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool)
```

_Moves a `value` amount of tokens from the caller's account to `to`.

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.

Emits a {Transfer} event._

### allowance

```solidity
function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256)
```

_Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be
allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through {transferFrom}. This is
zero by default.

This value changes when {approve} or {transferFrom} are called._

### approve

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 value) external returns (bool)
```

_Sets a `value` amount of tokens as the allowance of `spender` over the
caller's tokens.

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.

IMPORTANT: Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk
that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate
transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race
condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the
desired value afterwards:

### transferFrom

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool)
```

_Moves a `value` amount of tokens from `from` to `to` using the
allowance mechanism. `value` is then deducted from the caller's
allowance.

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded.
